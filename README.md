- 👋 Hi, I’m @juliah90, I ramble and self learn most things. Web development is my current mountain but it will not by my last.
- 👀 I’m interested in getting a remote job that pays enough to get my own house, that is the only goal. I wish to live in the middle of nowhere with my plants and cats.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web developement. I have already taken a course in full stack and am now both self learning and taking certifications and various online courses to learn more in depth.
- 💞️ I’m currently not looking to collaborate on plans, I am still learning the basics and hope to have them down in under a years time.
